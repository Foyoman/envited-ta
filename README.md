# Edward's Technical Assessment for Envited

Hi Envited/Mihailo! Here is my attempt for the technical assessment. Please:
- Clone this onto your local machine
- ```npm i --force``` to install all dependencies. ```--force``` is required as I am using 'Typed', a package for typing animations, like what you have on your official site (the program still works 100% and this doesn't seem to cause any issues).
- ```npm start``` to view the project on your local machine

I'd also like to let you know that I actually cloned your site to practice in preparation for this test! [Here](https://github.com/Foyoman/envited-clone) is the link to the repo, I hope you appreciate it! I definitely feel proud that I did it :)

*Also please note that I made a changes on 28/9, 2 days after my TA. I apologise for having to do this and I realise it is unfair for the other candidates, but I didn't realise the monitor I was using during the TA was at a much higher resolution than expected (27 inch 1440p). I only changed a few lines of CSS to fit how I would have done it using a more common screen size and resolution, and you can see how much I changed in the logs. Apologies!

## Features
- Desktop, iPad, *and* mobile responsive. I used Chrome's 'responsive' mode in the console to test responsiveness. Tested with the options for 'iPhone 12 Pro' and 'iPad Pro'.
- Dynamic typing effect
- Dynamically animated background gradient on the buttons
