# Edward's envited clone

Hi team @ envited / Mihailo! In preparation for my technical assessment I decided to practice by recreating your site.

[Here](https://envited-clone.netlify.app/) is the link to the deployed site on netlify!

It is only a wireframe/aesthetic clone of your site, the buttons don't do anything or lead anywhere. It's both desktop *and* mobile friendly, although the mobile version is a bit bugged, where some mobile browsers' navigation bar aren't counted as part of the viewport.

## Features
- Dynamic typing effect
- Snap scrolling
- Dynamically animated background gradient on the buttons
